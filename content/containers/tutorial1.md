For all of the following tutorials, we will use Docker as the container software
of choice. How to install Docker varies quite a lot between different operating systems.

Please follow the instructions relevant to you:

#### Windows
* Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

Note: If you are using Windows 10 Home Edition, please install Docker Toolbox instead.

#### MacOS      
* MacOS: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/

#### Linux:
* [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
* [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
* [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
* [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)

You will probably need to restart your computer as part of the installation process.
