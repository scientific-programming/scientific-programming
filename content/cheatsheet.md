The following is a list of standard commands in cmd on Windows or Bash on *nix systems.
It's by no means a comprehensive list - these are just to help you

Sometimes the commands I'll show (which are used for navigating around on Linux or 
Unix based systems like Macs) don't work in Windows. So here, I've put a list of
things you might want to do, and the commands in both Windows and Linux.


Concept                           |      Windows cmd command      | Linux

  Change directory into folder X  | cd X                          | cd X
  List files                      | dir                           | ls
  Show the current directory      | cd                            | pwd
  Copy filenamed A to B           | copy A B                      | cp A B
  Delete file A                   | del A                         | rm A
  Delete folder A                 | rmdir A                       | rm -r A
  Move file A to B                | move A B                      | mv A B
  Create a folder called A        | mkdir A                       | mkdir A
